<p><img src="./Using 4G LTE wireless modems on a Raspberry Pi _ Jeff Geerling_files/raspberry-pi-lte-modem-hardware-4g-wireless.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi 4 model B with 4G LTE wireless Quectel modem and antenna and USB adapter" width="700" height="442" class="insert-image"></p>

<p>I figured I'd document the process in this blog post so people who follow in my footsteps don't need to spend quite as much time researching. This post is the culmination of 40+ hours of reading, testing, and head-scratching.</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be any good central resource for "4G LTE and Linux" out there, just a thousand posts about the ABC's of getting an Internet connection working through a 4G modem—but with precious little explanation about <em>why</em> or <em>how</em> it works. (Or why someone should care about random terms like PPP, ECM, QMI, or MBIM, or why someone would choose <code>qmi_wwan</code> over <code>cdc_ether</code>, or ... I could go on).</p>

<p>Hopefully you can learn something from my notes. Or point out places where I'm glaringly wrong :)</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>The hardware requirements are not too bad, and remarkably affordable. You'll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Raspberry Pi (almost any will do, though I used a Raspberry Pi 4 (with a USB adapter) and a Compute Module 4 (with a carrier board with a mini PCIe slot).</li>
<li>A mini PCI Express 4G LTE modem. I used a <a href="https://amzn.to/3A3ey8A">Quectel EC25-A</a>, but there are some from Sierra Wireless I've heard recommended too.</li>
<li>(If not using a CM4 + LTE carrier board) A USB to mini PCIe adapter with built-in SIM tray. I used <a href="https://amzn.to/33Ge38q">this one from Timack</a> but any should do—just make sure it has a SIM try built-in! There are even <a href="https://amzn.to/3tPQips">Pi HATs like this one</a> that place the modem hardware directly atop the Pi.</li>
<li>A SIM card with a 4G data plan. I bought a <a href="https://sixfab.com/sim/">SixFab SIM</a> and used their monthly pay-as-you-go service for testing. You could pull out the SIM from your mobile phone (on most carriers at least) but that is a bit inconvenient as your phone won't get service until you put the SIM back in. You could also get a plan and SIM from any major carrier (e.g. AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon in the USA)—though you have to make sure the carrier you use works with the LTE modem you have!</li>
<li>An antenna—most modems have plugs for LTE main, LTE diversity, and GPS/GNSS. I typically use <a href="https://sixfab.com/product/lte-main-diversity-gnss-triple-port-u-fl-antenna-100mm/">this Pulse Electronics U.FL antenna</a> in a pinch, but there are many options for different needs (e.g. outdoor antennas, antennas with longer cables and <a href="https://amzn.to/3qHLyAe">SMA to U.FL adapters</a>)—you have to figure out exactly what you need depending on your environment.</li>
<li>(Depending on the SIM) If you want to use the SIM from your phone—which might be a nano SIM—you should also have on hand a cheap SIM Adapter set <a href="https://amzn.to/3fHGTbe">like the one I use</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To save on cost, I bought most of the things I used on eBay, where the price was 30-50% less than buying new on Amazon or SixFab's store. Since there are a <em>lot</em> of enterprise deployments using this type of gear, there's a <em>lot</em> of stock on the used market. Just know that some of it is pretty beat up—so buy only from reputable vendors!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: All the instructions in this post assume you're in the US. If you're in another country, some things need changing—for example, the Quectel modem comes in different varieties for different geographical regions, like the EC25-E for Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have everything together, insert the SIM in the SIM tray on your USB adapter or CM4 carrier board, install the LTE modem in the Mini PCIe slot. If you have a USB adapter, plug that USB adapter into one of the Pi's USB ports—which port doesn't really matter since all these devices operate over USB 2.0 (480 Mbps).</p>

<h2>Data Plans</h2>

<p>Before getting to the setup process, I thought I'd jot down a few notes about data plans, since at least in my part of the USA, it's kinda hard to find generous data packages with features like static IP addresses for a reasonable price.</p>

<p>Just as a point of estimation, it cost me about $30 for 10 GB of data (if pre-purchased), and I can find a few plans that offer 30-50 GB/month for $60-90/month.</p>

<p>I used to have an unlimited plan from AT&amp;T, but they severely throttled data once you went past a certain cap (down to like 100 Kbps, which is excruciating), so I switched to a 30 GB/month shared plan a couple years ago.</p>

<p>I also investigated getting a static public IPv4 address, but that was prohibitively expensive with the carriers I checked on. Instead, you may be able to get a routable IPv6 address—some carriers support this, and some network configurations will work with it. But YMMV, and you should be prepared to <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/ssh-and-http-raspberry-pi-behind-cg-nat">deal with CG-NAT</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>WARNING</strong>: If you set a Pi up as a webserver or some other type of server that's constantly using data, be careful—you could end up racking up <em>huge</em> overage charges if you're not careful.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Pi Setup</h2>

<p>These modems are widely supported in Linux, and even in Raspberry Pi OS (which is based on Debian).</p>

<p>Since I used a SixFab SIM, I had to log into my SixFab account and set the SIM to be 'active' before it was able to connect to AT&amp;T's network.</p>

<p>With the Raspberry Pi booted up, in a Terminal window, enter in <code>lsusb</code> and you should see something like:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ lsusb
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 2c7c:0125 Quectel Wireless Solutions Co., Ltd. EC25 LTE modem
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 2109:3431 VIA Labs, Inc. Hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

pi@lte:~ $ lsusb -t
...
/:  Bus 01.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/1p, 480M
    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/4p, 480M
        |__ Port 2: Dev 3, If 4, Class=Vendor Specific Class, Driver=qmi_wwan, 480M
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't see the modem listed in the output, you might not have plugged it in all the way, or your USB adapter or CM4 carrier board hasn't routed the USB signal properly (I've encountered a few broken implementations, so it's not out of the question).</p>

<p>If you check the kernel logs with <code>dmesg</code>, you may also see some messages from <code>qmi_wwan</code>, like:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ dmesg | grep qmi
[    5.701450] qmi_wwan 1-1.2:1.4: cdc-wdm0: USB WDM device
[    5.703022] qmi_wwan 1-1.2:1.4 wwan0: register 'qmi_wwan' at usb-0000:01:00.0-1.2, WWAN/QMI device, 02:5c:84:4e:14:51
[    5.703245] usbcore: registered new interface driver qmi_wwan
</code></pre>

<p>And a device is listed as <code>cdc-wdm0</code>:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ ls /dev/cdc*
/dev/cdc-wdm0
</code></pre>

<p>What may not be obvious—since these 4G modems are physically in a mini PCIe card form factor—is that they don't show up as PCI Express devices (even on a Compute Module 4 board). They show up as USB devices.</p>

<p>Anyways, the card <em>should</em> automatically show up on as a <code>wwan</code> network interface, usually <code>wwan0</code>:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ ip a
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
...
3: wwan0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 02:5c:84:4e:14:51 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 169.254.231.106/16 brd 169.254.255.255 scope global noprefixroute wwan0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::8284:d6cd:67d2:ca3a/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
</code></pre>

<p>You can try <em>using</em> this interface already using <code>ping</code>, but since it's not configured yet, it most likely won't work:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ ping -I wwan0 www.google.com -c 5
PING www.google.com (142.251.32.4) from 169.254.231.106 wwan0: 56(84) bytes of data.

--- www.google.com ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 4085ms
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, you'll need to make a decision—do you want to use the device</p>

<h2>QMI Mode setup (as <code>wwan0</code>)</h2>

<p>There's a longer history about the relationship of QMI, MBIM, and PPP modes for these modems, which I don't know if I have time to get into here. But in general, you should use a modem like the Quectel I'm using in either QMI or ECM mode.</p>

<p>All the modems I've purchased seem to be in PPP/QMI mode by default (<code>usbmode</code> returns <code>0</code>—more on that later). This seems to automatically make the device use the <code>qmi_wwan</code> driver and expose a <code>wwan0</code> interface.</p>

<p>SixFab has an excellent guide for getting started with this mode: <a href="https://docs.sixfab.com/page/setting-up-a-data-connection-over-qmi-interface-using-libqmi">Setting up a data connection over QMI interface using libqmi</a>.</p>

<p>You need to install a few utilities to interact with the modem via QMI:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install libqmi-utils udhcpc
</code></pre>

<p>Then check the current operating mode for the modem:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ sudo qmicli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --dms-get-operating-mode
[/dev/cdc-wdm0] Operating mode retrieved:
    Mode: 'online'
    HW restricted: 'no'
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: If this returns a <code>Resource temporarily unavailable</code> error after a bit, you might need to <em>first</em> stop ModemManager (if it's installed and running) with <code>sudo systemctl stop ModemManager</code>, then try again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it doesn't return <code>online</code>, run <code>sudo qmicli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --dms-set-operating-mode='online'</code> to set it online.</p>

<p>Then set the interface into <code>raw_ip</code> mode:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ sudo ip link set wwan0 down
pi@lte:~ $ echo 'Y' | sudo tee /sys/class/net/wwan0/qmi/raw_ip
Y
pi@lte:~ $ sudo ip link set wwan0 up
</code></pre>

<p>Confirm it's in the <code>raw-ip</code> mode with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ sudo qmicli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --wda-get-data-format
[/dev/cdc-wdm0] Successfully got data format
                   QoS flow header: no
               Link layer protocol: 'raw-ip'
...
</code></pre>

<p>Now it's finally time to connect to the network your SIM card is affiliated with! You need to know the APN for the network—in my case I'm using <code>super</code> for the SixFab card, but a common one for AT&amp;T SIMs like the one I use in my iPhone is <code>nxtgenphone</code>. Cradlepoint maintains a <a href="https://customer.cradlepoint.com/s/article/access-point-names-by-carrier">list of common APNs by carrier</a>, but to know what it should be, the easiest thing is to ask your provider.</p>

<p>Run the following command to connect:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ sudo qmicli -p -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --device-open-net='net-raw-ip|net-no-qos-header' --wds-start-network="apn='YOUR_APN',ip-type=4" --client-no-release-cid
[/dev/cdc-wdm0] Network started
    Packet data handle: '2267587312'
[/dev/cdc-wdm0] Client ID not released:
    Service: 'wds'
        CID: '19'
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: If you have a username and password, you can add those in after the apn, e.g. <code>apn='YOUR_APN',username='YOUR_USERNAME',password='YOUR_PASSWORD',ip-type=4</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, configure <code>udhcpc</code> to assign a default IP address and route:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ sudo udhcpc -q -f -i wwan0
udhcpc: started, v1.30.1
No resolv.conf for interface wwan0.udhcpc
udhcpc: sending discover
udhcpc: sending select for 10.228.89.96
udhcpc: lease of 10.228.89.96 obtained, lease time 7200
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, if you use <code>ip a</code>, you should see the new settings for the modem:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ ip a
...
3: wwan0: &lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/none 
    inet 10.228.89.96/26 scope global wwan0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
</code></pre>

<p>And, if everything worked correctly, you should see some successful pings:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ ping -I wwan0 www.google.com -c 5
PING www.google.com (142.250.190.68) from 10.228.89.96 wwan0: 56(84) bytes of data.

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 46.260/53.975/74.403/10.342 ms
</code></pre>

<p>Yay! But once you restart the Pi, the network connection is lost.</p>

<p>After a reboot, you have to re-run the following commands to connect again:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ sudo ip link set wwan0 down
pi@lte:~ $ echo 'Y' | sudo tee /sys/class/net/wwan0/qmi/raw_ip
pi@lte:~ $ sudo ip link set wwan0 up
pi@lte:~ $ sudo qmicli -p -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --device-open-net='net-raw-ip|net-no-qos-header' --wds-start-network="apn='YOUR_APN',ip-type=4" --client-no-release-cid
pi@lte:~ $ sudo udhcpc -q -f -i wwan0
</code></pre>

<p>Even though <code>sudo qmicli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --wda-get-data-format</code> shows it's in <code>raw-ip</code> mode, it seems you still have to stop the interface, force <code>raw_ip</code>, and start the interface, then you can connect and set up the IP and routing with <code>udhcpc</code>.</p>

<h3>Automatic re-connection</h3>

<p>The simplest way to set up automatic re-connection is to add the following contents in a new file for the <code>wwan0</code> interface:</p>

<pre><code># Create the file.
pi@lte:~ $ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/wwan0

# Paste in the following contents (replacing with your own APN).
iface wwan0 inet manual
     pre-up ifconfig wwan0 down
     pre-up echo Y &gt; /sys/class/net/wwan0/qmi/raw_ip
     pre-up for _ in $(seq 1 10); do /usr/bin/test -c /dev/cdc-wdm0 &amp;&amp; break; /bin/sleep 1; done
     pre-up for _ in $(seq 1 10); do /usr/bin/qmicli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --nas-get-signal-strength &amp;&amp; break; /bin/sleep 1; done
     pre-up sudo qmicli -p -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --device-open-net='net-raw-ip|net-no-qos-header' --wds-start-network="apn='nxtgenphone',ip-type=4" --client-no-release-cid
     pre-up udhcpc -i wwan0
     post-down /usr/bin/qmi-network /dev/cdc-wdm0 stop
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Be sure to include username and password as stated earlier, if your SIM plan requires it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reboot (<code>sudo reboot</code>) and once rebooted, run the following to manage the connection:</p>

<pre><code># Bring up the connection.
pi@lte:~ $ sudo ifup wwan0

# Bring down the connection.
pi@lte:~ $ sudo ifdown wwan0
</code></pre>

<p>And check if there's a route to the internet via <code>wwan0</code> with <code>route -n</code> (or try a ping through the interface).</p>

<p>If you want the interface to come up at system boot, add the line <code>auto wwan0</code> above the <code>iface</code> line in the <code>/etc/network/interfaces.d/wwan0</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>auto wwan0
iface wwan0 inet manual
</code></pre>

<p>Now after a reboot, the interface should come up automatically, instead of requiring a manual <code>sudo ifup wwan0</code>.</p>

<h3>Other helpful QMI modem commands</h3>

<pre><code>sudo qmicli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --nas-get-signal-info
sudo qmicli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --nas-get-signal-strength
sudo qmicli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --nas-get-home-network
sudo qmicli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --nas-get-serving-system
sudo qmi-network /dev/cdc-wdm0 status
sudo qmicli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0  --wds-get-packet-service-status
</code></pre>

<h2>ECM mode setup (<code>usb0</code>)</h2>

<p>SixFab has a great guide for <a href="https://docs.sixfab.com/page/internet-connection-with-quectel-ec25-by-using-ecm-mode">setting the modem into ECM mode</a>, which exposes a <code>usb0</code> network interface instead of a <code>wwan0</code> interface.</p>

<p>Assuming you did all the QMI mode setup, first make sure the interface is down with <code>sudo ifdown wwan0</code>. Also comment out all the lines in <code>/etc/network/interfaces.d/wwan0</code> (or delete that file).</p>

<p>To switch to ECM mode, you need to use <code>minicom</code> to communicate with the modem over it's serial port:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ sudo apt install minicom -y
pi@lte:~ $ minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB2 -b 115200
</code></pre>

<p>This should open a serial connection. Type in <code>AT</code> and press 'Enter', and you should see <code>OK</code>. We're gonna talk old school AT commands to the modem, the first one being the command to check the current <code>usbmode</code>:</p>

<pre><code>AT+QCFG="usbnet"
</code></pre>

<p>That will likely return <code>+QCFG: "usbnet",0</code>, but we need that to be set to <code>1</code> (ECM mode), so enter the following command:</p>

<pre><code>AT+QCFG="usbnet",1
</code></pre>

<p>The modem may reboot itself automatically, but if not, enter the following command to force a reboot:</p>

<pre><code>AT+CFUN=1,1
</code></pre>

<p><em>See, it's fun!</em></p>

<p>After 5 seconds or so, you'll see a warning pop up in minicom like <code>Cannot open /dev/ttyUSB2!</code>. It will go away, and you'll start seeing some more information go by as the modem completes its boot process.</p>

<p>Once you can type <code>AT</code> again and get <code>OK</code>, it's time to make sure the APN is correct. Enter the following command (but make sure you put in the correct APN for your SIM...):</p>

<pre><code>AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","YOUR_APN"
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, restart the modem again:</p>

<pre><code>AT+CFUN=1,1
</code></pre>

<p>Wait for the modem to reboot, then exit minicom: press Ctrl-A, then press Z, and minicom's help comes up. Press X to leave minicom and confirm you want to leave it by hitting Enter.</p>

<p>Now reboot the Raspberry Pi (<code>sudo reboot</code>), then check if you got an IP address on the <code>usb0</code> interface:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ ifconfig usb0
usb0: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.225.24  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.225.255
        inet6 fe80::1f80:5523:108c:a9eb  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20&lt;link&gt;
        ether a6:51:1c:3f:79:1c  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 24  bytes 2153 (2.1 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 33  bytes 4162 (4.0 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
</code></pre>

<p>And confirm the modem is using the <code>cdc_ether</code> driver instead of <code>qmi_wwan</code>:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ lsusb
...
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 2c7c:0125 Quectel Wireless Solutions Co., Ltd. EC25 LTE modem

pi@lte:~ $ lsusb -t
...
/:  Bus 01.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/1p, 480M
    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/4p, 480M
        |__ Port 2: Dev 3, If 4, Class=Communications, Driver=cdc_ether, 480M
        |__ Port 2: Dev 3, If 5, Class=CDC Data, Driver=cdc_ether, 480M
</code></pre>

<p>Test if you can reach the Internet through the <code>usb0</code> interface:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ ping -I usb0 www.google.com -c 5
PING www.google.com (142.250.190.68) from 192.168.225.24 usb0: 56(84) bytes of data.

</code></pre>

<p>Hooray! The best thing about this setup is it seems to come up automatically after a reboot on its own—no need for any network interface or <code>qmicli</code> shenanigans.</p>

<p>You can still disable the <code>usb0</code> interface with:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ sudo ip link set usb0 down
</code></pre>

</code></pre>

<h3>Built-in AP configuration</h3>

<p>It seems another side effect of using the <code>usb0</code> interface is the <em>modem itself</em> is where all the management happens, and at least on my Quectel modem, if you open up the gateway IP address in a router (e.g. <code>https://192.168.225.1/</code>), bypassing certificate warnings, you end up with a little 'Qualcomm MobileAP' login page like:</p>

<p><img src="./Using 4G LTE wireless modems on a Raspberry Pi _ Jeff Geerling_files/Qualcomm-MobileAP-login-page.jpg" alt="Qualcomm MobileAP Login Page" width="600" height="365" class="insert-image"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Since I was operating the Pi headless, and browsing pages via <code>curl</code> is all but impossible, I accessed the site from my Mac using an SSH tunnel (<code>ssh -D 8080 pi@lte.local</code>), then I configured my network to use a SOCKS5 proxy with address <code>localhost</code> and port <code>8080</code>). Then I could access the IP address of the modem in my Mac's browser (Chrome, in this case).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The UI looks ancient (and like many ancient designs, is likely <a href="https://jfrog.com/blog/major-vulnerabilities-discovered-in-qualcomm-qcmap/">vulnerable to many kinds of attacks</a>), but it did seem to have a number of settings like a built-in firewall, some DHCP options, and basic WWAN settings:</p>

<p><img src="./Using 4G LTE wireless modems on a Raspberry Pi _ Jeff Geerling_files/Qualcomm-MobileAP-WWAN-settings.jpg" alt="Qualcomm MobileAP WWAN settings page" width="600" height="365" class="insert-image"></p>

<p>It's not a very intuitive UI, though—and I also didn't see any easy way to do a 'factory reset' or to upgrade the modem from within the MobileAP interface. Seeing the copyright of 2014 didn't inspire a whole lot of confidence there :P</p>

<h2>Updating Firmware</h2>

<p>But speaking of the modem's firmware, there <em>has</em> to be a way it can be updated, right? Well... there <em>is</em>, with a tool called QFlash, which I found in the 'Tools' section of the <a href="https://sixfab.com/product/quectel-ec25-mini-pcie-4g-lte-module/">EC25 page</a> on SixFab's website.</p>

<p>But it references firmware files that are seemingly conjured up out of thin air, as if by magic.</p>

<p>The only firmware files I could find available for download were through random Google Drive links <a href="https://community.sixfab.com/t/quectel-ec25-firmware-update/1690/3">on forum postings</a> or <a href="https://community.sixfab.com/t/at-t-upgrade-kills-my-data-connection/1447/2?u=geerlingguy">expired WeTransfer links</a>. Yeah, like I'm gonna do that!</p>

<p>And if you search Quectel's forums, you'll find threads like <a href="https://forums.quectel.com/t/firmware-for-ec25-a-and-ec25-af/3534/2">this one</a>, which seemingly never get resolved:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quectel Rep: If you need the latest firmware, you can send email to support@quectel.com to get it, you can provide the firmware you used now, then we will arrange local FAE to support you, they will help to provide the latest firmware package, the upgrade tool and guide you how to upgrade it. Thanks!</p>
  
  <p>Customer: I tried again to request firmware from support earlier this week. Any idea what sort of time I should expect for a typical firmware request?</p>
  
  <p>Quectel Rep: Please provide your email and company name, your country to us, we will arrange local FAE to support you as soon as possible.</p>
  
  <p>Customer: [after doing this loop a few times] ... 😑</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yeah... not sure why it's not possible for Quectel to just provide a firmware download page. And it looks like this isn't the first time someone's hit a brick wall communicating with Quectel; I found <a href="https://laforge.gnumonks.org/blog/20161230-33c3-presentation/">Harald Welte's OSMOCOM presentation</a> suggesting it was difficult getting Quectel to provide the sources for their on-chip Linux build.</p>

<h2>Choosing QMI or ECM</h2>

<p>When I started out on my journey towards understanding 4G LTE on a Pi, I was quickly confused by the fact that almost every tutorial and setup guide had completely different instructions—and some where basically copy-and-paste of someone else's guide.</p>

<p>But nobody seemed to ever talk about the different connection methods: why do multiple methods exist? Why do modems (at least the Quectel) come with QMI and <code>wwan0</code> set up by default? Is one method faster and/or better supported than another?</p>

<p><em>Don't know.</em></p>

<p>So I did a bit of testing in <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/344">this GitHub issue</a>, and found (informally, at least) that I could get consistently better latency and upload speeds with the ECM driver (<code>cdc_ether</code>).</p>

<p>What's more, that driver (which sets up the <code>usb0</code> interface) seems to work <em>out of the box</em> with everything in Linux, <em>doesn't</em> require me to set up a custom interface file with a bunch of extra commands, and is set up automatically just like any other network interface.</p>

<p>Am I missing something? Is there any upside to using the default QMI / <code>qmi_wwan</code> / <code>wwan0</code>?</p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/geerlingguy/status/1484232529192407042">asked about it on Twitter</a> and will update this post if I find anything conclusive.</p>

<h2>Selecting the default interface for Internet access</h2>

<p>With an active 4G LTE interface (whether <code>wwan0</code> or <code>usb0</code>), there could be a new problem: what if you have <em>two</em> interfaces providing Internet connectivity? For example, what if your Pi also has a WiFi or Ethernet connection that has more stable or faster Internet, and you just want to use the LTE connection as a backup?</p>

<p>I won't get <em>too</em> deep in the weeds, but you can see how Linux will prioritize routing of the Internet connection by running <code>route</code>:</p>

<pre><code>pi@lte:~ $ route
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         mobileap.qualco 0.0.0.0         UG    204    0        0 usb0
default         10.0.100.1      0.0.0.0         UG    303    0        0 wlan0
10.0.100.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     303    0        0 wlan0
192.168.225.0   0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     204    0        0 usb0
</code></pre>

<p>I actually wrote up an entire blog post on how to change the <code>metric</code>, so Linux will route through a different interface. Check out that post for all the details: <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/network-interface-routing-priority-on-raspberry-pi">Network interface routing priority on a Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>

<p>But for the tl;dr: Linux will route packets through whichever interface has the lowest <code>Metric</code> (which in the case above is <code>usb0</code>) and matches the <code>Gateway</code> IP range (<code>0.0.0.0</code> means 'any IP address', basically).</p>

<p>So check out the linked blog post if you need to manage the Metric priority for different devices.</p>

<p>One case where that solution <em>isn't</em> so helpful is with the modem in QMI mode (<code>wwan0</code>). Since that's using <code>udhcpc</code> instead of the system's built-in <code>dhcpcd</code>, setting the metric is not as straightforward as I hoped.</p>

<p>Based on the <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Udhcpc">udhcpc documentation</a>, I thought I could just add a file <code>/etc/udhcpc/udhcpc.conf</code> and put <code>IF_METRIC=400</code> inside, and that would be picked up as the routing metric... but that didn't seem to work. More investigation is needed.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I naïvely thought, coming into this project, that 4G LTE connectivity would be rather simple. But it's not. And it seems like there are basically two layers of documentation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Datasheets and code comments that expect expert-level understanding already.</li>
<li>Beginner-level guides like "how to get your Pi connected to the Internet"</li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully some of what I wrote here can bridge the gap between those two levels—but I gotta be honest, I typically don't like writing a blog post when I only have a partial understanding of the subject... and that's what I have here. So take what I say about 4G LTE with a grain of salt ;)</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-comment-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>It was suggested in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30016726">this comment on HN</a> that using ModemManager (with <code>mmcli</code> headless) might be the best option, and having the card in QMI mode. Here's the majority of that comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In QMI mode, the LTE interface is directly connected to your system, the 10.... IP you got is the one assigned by your carrier (I am not sure where the initial 169.254.231.106 IP it had before you established the connection came from) and your machine is directly reachable from the Internet.</p>
  
  <p>In ECM mode, you are given a fake Ethernet interface that's connected to a router and NAT gateway ran by the LTE module itself; this is also where that web interface comes from. In this mode, the module's router part is the one exposed to the internet and acts as a router/firewall/NAT gateway - your computer is not directly reachable unless you use that web interface to forward a port. Given the usual "quality" of these (as you witnessed by looking at the UI) I would not be surprised if there are exploits or bugs in there.</p>
  
  <p>There should also be a third mode, where the modem exposes one or more serial ports that accept AT commands and you can establish a connection over it using wvdial/pppd just like good old dial-up. This is worse than QMI mode but preferable to ECM mode as you still get your system directly connected to the internet without relying on the modem's router/gateway part.</p>
  
  <p>In general, I would recommend QMI mode - it is a breath of fresh air compared to the old school way of the modem exposing multiple serial ports and having to do dial-up on it. It does require some work but it's a solved problem - for desktop Linux look into ModemManager, or alternatively look into how OpenWRT deals with it for a potentially lighter alternative.</p>

<p>For an LTE modem, there's tons of Dell DW5811e cards out on the used market. They are actually Sierra EM7455.</p>
<p>For a cheap IoT SIM, go to Amazon and search for ASIN B07JCTZ3BF. This IoTDataWorks plan is rate limited to 64kbps, but has no data limit. On an annualized basis it's a pretty good deal.</p>

As you said, there is very little useful information out there on how to set up these boards/HATs. Even the sample code from the manufactures do not Explain the underlying details.<br>
My own UseCase is simple (and not at all unique) : I want to build a Raspberry Pi standalone IoT sensor, that will be installed many miles from a WiFi network, so I've bought a few HATs and (expensive!!) SIM cards :-(<br>
Thanks to your article, I now have one (Waveshare SIM7000) connected to the outside world (can use your ping successfully). I can't currently see web pages hosted on the PI via LTE (but can locally when I have my WiFi turned on).... I'll crack on and get it working, but it's all harder than it should be :-).</p>
<p>Keep up the good work.</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-comment-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I just re-read this.<br>
I use a TOFU board which has the .m2 interface on the rear of the CM4 board and a sim slot.<br>
This is really a nice way to go.<br>
FYI,<br>
There are quite big differences with bullseye, and the setup is far from bugfree, ie. can often disconnect or do all kinds of bad stuff.<br>
Setting up modemmanager as a service, so that it boots up from scratch has to be the way to go.</p>
<p>Being as the CM4 chips are pretty much unobtanium, (esp the ones with wifi and lots of RAM), it's quite a struggle to implement any strategy reliably right now, so for the present I use a standalone modem board with router OS, a highly minaturised credit sized board made in Russia (er yes!), instead of the less well designed microtik offerings originated in Latvia.</p>
<p>The biggest hic on any router/Sim/4g-LTE system is roaming, which we in Europe simply have to have if any routing system is installed in anything mobile like a vehicle. (ask me about that!).<br>
That's another whole can of worms.</p>

I have really enjoyed this tutorial. I have a twist to it though.<br>
I have a requirement for a dual-WAN portable router, using 2 SIM cards, with the ability to configure WAN failover, load balance, or bonding. For now, I am looking at the failover. Suppose I connect 2 4G USB dongles to the Pi4, there should be a way to achieve this scenario, I believe.</p>
